	Crispy chicken consists of chicken pieces that are coated with seasoned flour or batter and then fried. The breading adds a crisp coating to the exterior while retaining juices inside the meat. Fried chicken is tasty, but it does have a lot more fat and calories compared to roasted chicken.</section>
